Sleep apnea cost can be estimated by method shown in  *[Armeni et al. (2019) Cost-of-illness study of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in Italy](https://cergas.unibocconi.eu/sites/default/files/files/Cost-of-illness-study-of-Obstructive-Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome-%2528OSAS%2529-in-Italy_Report%25281%2529.pdf)*. This project utilize it with open data science methods.

We are interested sleep apnea costs in Europe between age group of 15-74 years old. Data is collected from the year 2019. Following countries are included to the estimation:

```{r echo=FALSE}
countries <- c("Albania","Andorra","Armenia","Austria","Azerbaijan","Belarus","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Croatia","Cyprus","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Georgia","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Iceland","Ireland","Italy","Kazakhstan","Latvia","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Malta","Republic of Moldova","Monaco","Montenegro","Netherlands","North Macedonia","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russian Federation","San Marino","Serbia","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey","Ukraine","United Kingdom")
